    My name is: Belete Zegeye<br />
    My favorite food is <b>Injera</b>.
    <p>
        <b>Injera</b> little detail about Injera<br />
        <b>Injera</b> is made with teff, a tiny,<br />
        round grain that flourishes in the highlands of Ethiopia.<br />
        While teff is very nutritious, it contains practically no gluten.<br />
        This makes teff ill-suited for making raised bread,<br />
        however injera still takes advantage of the special properties of yeast.<br />
